# Methodological issues and common biases

## does cognitive skills really deteriorate when a person is deprived of sleep?

- inadequate description of study or failure to control variables makes the result harder to interpret
- the test result can be affected by the circadian rhythm if the task is done only once

## expensiveness of sleep deprivation study

- small sample size
- larger population -> other methodological issues
- difficult to compare the results between subjects

## other variables that can be improved

- unfamiliar surroundings -> impair sleep quality
    - often neglected in some studies
    - eg. Harrison and Horne 2000, Jennings et al 2003, Choo et al 2005
    - sleeping at home has another problem -> can't control variables
    - using data from first night, second night is questionable.
    - 
- adding EEG recording
    - to confirm the awakeness of subjects

## common pitfalls

- recruitment
    - need randomized subjects
    - advertisement or clinics -> favors selection of people who has sleep problems
- sleeping habits should be controlled 
- use of medications should be prohibited

## Summing up
- avoid practice effect
- attention is involved in any cognitive skills
- neuroimaging techniques are useful but limiting the ability of study
- criteria for neurocognitive tests -> Dorrian (2005), useful, independent of aptitude, repeatable
